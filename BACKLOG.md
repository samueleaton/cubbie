- [ ] Update `once` method to actually remove the listener once it is ran instead of it just being ignored
- [x] implement a deep freeze and do not ever clone current state

Backlog to reach v2.1.0:

- [ ] Add a resetInitalState method which will set the current state as the new initial state and remove the state history
