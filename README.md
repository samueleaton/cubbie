> State shouldn't be a chore, keep your state in Cubbie's store

<br>  

## The Lowdown

Cubbie allows the creation of state stores. It will keep track of the state history as the state is modified. It is built on an event system that allows anybody to listen for any state event. [Event namespacing](docs/event_system.md#event-namespacing) is available to keep things manageable as lots of events are added.

If you are using Node.js (e.g. Electron) the entire state history can be synced to and from a file for persistent storage.

## Installation

```
npm i -S cubbie
```

## Usage

### Creating a Store

``` javascript
const cubbie = require('cubbie');

const store = cubbie.createStore();
```

Each store you create is independent, each managing its own state history. So if you want multiple <sub>smaller stores</sub> in your app rather than one **large store**, Cubbie will allow it.

``` javascript
const heroes = cubbie.createStore();
const villains = cubbie.createStore();
```

### Initial State

Before you can start tracking state, you need to set an initial state:

``` javascript
store.initialState = {currentPage: 'home', loggedIn: true, etc: '...'};
// or
store.setInitialState({currentPage: 'home', loggedIn: true, etc: '...'});
```

`initialState` triggers the `STATE_SET` event. See the **Events** section.

To get the initial state:

``` javascript
store.initialState;
```

### Current State

Accessing the current state is as simple as accessing the `state` property.

``` javascript
store.state;
```

### Modifying State

This is the key to Cubbie's simplicity. To modify state, just pass a function to `modifyState`. The only parameter of that function is the new state that you get to modify before it is set as the new state. 

``` javascript
store.modifyState(state => {
    state.x = y;
    state.z = 11;
    // etc.
});
```

This is an immutable operation and the newly modified state object will be added as the most recent member of the state history family.

You are modifying a new state object that *will become* the new stateâ€”*you are not modifying the "current state"*.

Example

``` javascript
store.stateHistory.length; // lets say its 1

store.modifyState(state => {
    state.x = y;
    state.z = 11;
    // etc.
});

store.stateHistory.length; // then now its 2
```

`modifyState` triggers the `STATE_MODIFIED` event. See [The Event System](docs/event_system.md).

`modifyState` will return the new current state.

### State History

Returns array of all of the states in history since the initial state.

``` javascript
store.stateHistory;
```

**Note:** Reverting or resetting the state will remove states from the state history. Modifying the state will append a new state to the state history.

To get the absolute raw state history (which includes each state timestamp and id) use `store.rawStateHistory`. So if for some reason you want to see the date/time when each state was created, this is how you can access that information.

### Get Previous State

This returns the state immediately before the current state.

``` javascript
store.previousState;
```

### Resetting State

This will reset the state to the initial state (the first state in the state history).

``` javascript
store.resetState();
```

`resetState` triggers the `STATE_RESET` event. See the **Events** section.

### Reverting the State

See [Reverting the State](docs/reverting_state.md)

### Views

Similar in purpose to SQL views, views allow you to store a function that you can call on at any moment. Its just some good ol' logic abstraction.

Example (using lodash's `maxBy`)

``` javascript
console.log(store.state); /* 
{ people: [
    {name: 'cat', age: 13}, {name: 'sam', age: 25}, {name: 'jas', age: 20}
  ]
}
*/


store.createView('oldestPerson', state => {
  return _.maxBy(state.people, person => person.age);
});

store.view('oldestPerson'); // {name: 'sam', age: 25}
```

### Purging the State History

If you want to clear the state history, for example to save memory, use the `purge` method.

Purging the store will remove all of the states from the state history **except for the current state**. Because the current state is the only state that is not removed, it will become the new initial state.

``` javascript
store.purge();
```

The `purge` method will trigger the `STORE_PURGED` event.

(**Note**: As of version 3.0.0, `purgeStateHistory` was removed in favor of `purge`, which no longer saves the initial state, just the current state)

### Cleaning the State History

Cleaning the store is much more advanced than purging. It will find states that are identical and remove everything in between.

``` javascript
store.clean();
```

See [Cleaning the Store](docs/cleaning_the_store.md)

### Static State

Internally, static state is a totally separate object from the normal state. It is meant to be set from the beginning of the app and it cannot be changed, unless you totally reset it.

The purpose is to store information that shouldn't need to be changed, such as URLs, file paths, config information, etc.

**Setting Static State**

``` javascript
store.staticState = {x: 11, y: 'yee'};
```

**Accessing Static State**

``` javascript
store.staticState;
```

### Enforcing Types and/or Values

### Saving State to Disk

If, for example, you are building an app in Electron and want to save the state to disk, you totes can.
